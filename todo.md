## The list maybe i currently want

- Main "salary"? since i currently have 3 types of salary, maybe new type of salary (freelance soon, amen)
- IT SHOULD BE INCOME, NOT SALARY, SO IT HAS OUTCOME TOO?
- "Spending type?" like weekly, monthly, or perhaps yearly.

## Learning Note
- To check the running port (for GO)
   ```shell
   lsof -i:8080
   ```
- To check and kill?
   ```shell
   lsof -ti:8080 | xargs kill -9
   ```
- go mod is node package manager but in go.

   -->Go's dependency management command - it's like Go's version of npm install or composer install.
   - Import in the code first, then do `go mod tidy`


# wifey note
- The Category of current income is (from me, not hers): Tukin, Gapok, Presence Money. (Can be added more later, Inshaallah we can get more income, aamiin)
- Make a budgeting cards. For example, the use case of money, like a categorize what the budget will be used for. for example, for whole months, for gas-- motorcycle gas budget is Rp 100.000 per week, if i fill the gas once, i'll add that gas category for example 50.000, then the week gas money is 100.000 - 50.000, so for the week for gas money is 50.000 left. not only gas, we will have like cooking shoping money, water money, etc, so i can add more later as card like the BalanceCard. so every this category have like how many left should we pay. I hope you understand.
- We decided that we "split" the money so its nice that we have like "person responsible" or "person in charge" of spending the above category (like the gas money is in me or hers)
